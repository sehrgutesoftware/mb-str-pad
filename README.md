# mb_str_pad()

> Multibyte-capable alternative to php's builtin str_pad() function

It has exactly the same interface as the original `str_pad()` function, which is documented here: [https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.str-pad.php](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.str-pad.php)

## Installation
```sh
composer require sehrgut/mb-str-pad
```

## Usage
Composer should autoload the `mb_str_pad()` function into global namespace. Use it just like any built-in function. 

## Testing
```sh
composer test
```
